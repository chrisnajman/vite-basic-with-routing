# Vite with Basic Routing

## Vite Setup (with Routing) and Easy Publish to Git Pages

This is a clone of ["vite-react-router" (Github repo) by Erick Kuwahara](https://github.com/ErickKS/vite-react-router/tree/main) with the following differences:

- I converted `.tsx` (typescript) files to `.jsx`.
- VS Code was complaining about it, so in `main.tsx` (which I renamed `main.jsx`) I removed `as HTMLElement` from:
  `ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(...`
- I extracted the `nav` to its own component (`components/Nav.js`).

## Installation and configuring the Git Repo

For all installation and configuration instructions see Erick's Github repo (link above).
